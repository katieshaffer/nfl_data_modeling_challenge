        The first two charts below ðŸ‘‡ **Most Frequent Offense Penalty Types**
        &amp; **Most Frequent Defense Penalty Types** show that a False Start is
        the most frequently penalised offence for the offense ðŸ˜‰ whilst
        Defensive Pass Interference is the most frequent offence for the
        defense.


        The **Red Zone Penalties** chart belowðŸ‘‡ shows that the Cowboys, Jets
        &amp; Broncos lead the way in playing on the edge &amp; conceding in the
        red zone whilst the **Most Frequent Offenders** chart ðŸ‘‰ indicates that
        Jawaan Taylor has the leading track record for conceding penalties.

        The two other dashboards in this submission have looked at how
        effectively teams on the offense can gain yards by passing or rushing.
        Penalties are different in that they can apply to both the offense and
        defense teams.


        #### Penalties and Yardages ðŸ‘ˆ 

        A scatter chart showing by team the number of penalties conceded on the
        y-axis and the number of yards conceded on the x-axis. The Houston
        Texans have conceded the most penalties (128) but the 49'ers the most
        yardage (1,076)


        #### Penalties to Win or Lose ðŸ‘‰

        Shows for each team the number of penalties they have conceded in a win
        (in blue) and the number they have conceded in a loss (in orange).
        Penalties have not worked well for the Panthers. Of their 103 penalties,
        96 of them have been conceded in losses.
