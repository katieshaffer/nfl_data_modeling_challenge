        Whatever the mix of passing &amp; rushing in a team's game plan, they
        will want to be able to measure who are their most effective passers and
        rushers. This is done on a game-per-game basis in the stacked charts
        below ðŸ‘‡ **Passer Yards** &amp; **Rusher Yards** where the legends show
        the names of the players who made the passes or the rushes.


        Then the charts on the right ðŸ‘‰ **Top Passers by Position** &amp; **Top
        Rushers by Position** aggregate the yardages by player &amp; position.
        Inevitably, quarter-backs dominate the passers chart whilst the rushers
        chart is more varied, reflecting the need to have pace as a threat
        across the pitch.

        Following on from the Hard Yards dashboard, this Passers and Rushers
        dashboards looks in more detail at the mix of strategies teams have used
        to win yards. The two charts to the left and right here illustrate how
        much a side's success in scoring more than the opposition depends on
        winning the yardage battle.


        #### Score Differential Trend ðŸ‘ˆ 

        A team's score differential is the margin by which they win or lose from
        game to game shown as a cumulative or running total.


        #### Yardage Differential Trend ðŸ‘‰

        A team's yardage differential is the margin by which they win or lose
        the yardage battle from game to game shown as a cumulative or running
        total.


        The shape of the trends in these charts tend to be very similar, showing
        the bearing that winning yards has on winning games.
