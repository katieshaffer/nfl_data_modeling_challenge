        Of the two measures that make up a team's total yards gained, total
        passing yards are always lkely to be a higher number than total rushing
        yards. Nonetheless the first two charts below ðŸ‘‡ **Top Passing
        Percentages** &amp; **Top Rushing Percentages**

        below highlight those teams which have optimised either passing &amp;/or
        rushing as a percentage of their total yards gained. 

        Then the chart **Win Percentages** ðŸ‘‰ shows for which teams there is any
        correlation between their effectiveness in passing &amp; rushing on one
        hand &amp; the percentage of games they win on the other. The Baltimore
        Ravens are an interesting example. They do not appear in the chart for
        **Top Passing Percentages** but are number 3 in the chart for **Top
        Rushing Percentages** and are first in terms of **Win Percentages**.

        NFL is a game of territory. Yards gained by a team are likely to have a
        bearing on the number of games they win. This dashboard is called The
        Hard Yards &amp; analyses the relationship between yards won &amp; games
        won &amp; whether teams can have strategies for winning those extra
        yards.


        #### Total Yards Gained by Team ðŸ‘ˆ 

        Total yards gained aka total offense is shown by the blue dots whilst
        the columns below show the numbers of passing yards (orange) and rushing
        yards (green) that make up the total yards gained for each team.


        #### Yardage Differentials ðŸ‘‰

        Yardage differential is the cumulative yardage amount by which a team
        out-performs or under-performs their opponents.
