## Introduction
For this edition of Paradime's data modeling challenge, I set out to uncover insights for fantasy football players using NFL-related datasets. My main goal was to analyze two key factors that impact fantasy performance:  
1. **Player Contracts** â€“ How does a player's contract status (rookie year, final year, mid-contract) relate to their fantasy performance?  
2. **Player Availability** â€“ Does past availability (games played) predict future fantasy output?  

To explore these questions, I combined player performance data with contract history, using dbtâ„¢, Snowflake, and visualization tools.

## Data Sources
I used two primary datasets:  

- **NFL_PLAYERS_STATS_2015_2025** â€“ A game-level dataset of NFL player statistics from the past 10 years, pulled using the `nfl_data_py` API (script provided by Paradime).  
- **NFL_CONTRACTS** â€“ A dataset containing 20+ years of player contract history. I scraped this data from [OverTheCap](https://overthecap.com/contract-history) using a custom Python script ([script link]).

## Methodology

### Tools Used
- **Paradime** â€“ dbtâ„¢ modeling and SQL  
- **Snowflake** â€“ Data warehousing  
- **Lightdash** â€“ Data visualization  
- **Python** â€“ Data extraction (from `nfl_data_py` and OverTheCap scraping)  

### Data Preparation & Modeling

1. Extracted 10 years of player data to ensure enough overlap between player contracts and performance.  
   - Longer contracts (4-6 years) mean some players might not have multiple contract periods within a shorter window.  
   - I avoided older data to minimize the impact of changes in the gameâ€™s style and rules.  

2. Built two **staging models**:  
   - `stg_contracts` â€“ Cleaned and structured contract data.  
   - `stg_player_stats_by_game` â€“ Organized player performance on a per-game basis.  

3. Created an **intermediate model** (`int_fantasy_points`) to:  
   - Aggregate performance data at the **season level**.  
   - Select the **top 100** players from each season based on:
     - **Total PPR points** (important for season-long leagues).  
     - **Average PPR points per game** (to account for injuries and missed games).  
   - While standard fantasy leagues typically have 150-240 rostered players, the **top 100** represents the **core fantasy-relevant players**â€”those who are consistently starters and have the most impact on season outcomes.  

   This approach ensures we donâ€™t exclude high-performing but injury-prone players solely due to missed games.  

4. Built **fact models** to analyze different aspects:  
   - `fct_contract_year` â€“ Identifies players' **first and last contract years** within the 10-year period.  
   - `fct_player_availability` â€“ Focuses on how **games played** affects fantasy performance.

## Visuals & Key Metrics

### General Analysis

I included two general visuals to gain a clearer understanding of the dataset:

1. **Number of players by position**  

![Visualization](viz/number_of_players_per_position.png)

2. **PPR distribution per position**  

![Visualization](viz/ppr_per_position.png)

### Contracts & Fantasy Performance
3. **PPR by is_final_year**  

![Visualization](viz/ppr_by_final_year.png)

I initially assumed that players' performances in their final year would be better than in any other season. However, this trend isn't apparent in the chart, so I proceeded with further analysis:

![Visualization](viz/ppr_by_first_year.png)

Looking at this visual, we can observe that players in their first contract year tend to perform worse, likely due to the challenges of rookie seasons.

![Visualization](viz/ppr_by_first_final_year.png)

Incorporating both flags into the analysis reveals some interesting insights. To improve interpretation, Iâ€™ve created these categories based on the two flags:

![Visualization](viz/ppr_by_contract_status.png)

Itâ€™s clear that players in the 'Mid-contract' phase perform the best, followed closely by those in their final year. Players on 1-year contracts have the lowest performance.


4. **Mid-contract performance breakdown** (by contract year & position)

After observing this, I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of 'Mid-contract' players, so I broke down the average PPR by the specific year of the contract the players are in:

![Visualization](viz/mid_contract_by_contract_year.png)

Players in their 6th year perform the best, while those in their second year have the lowest average PPR.

I also analyzed the breakdown by position:

![Visualization](viz/mid_contract_by_position.png)

Quarterbacks are the top performers, while tight ends rank the lowest.

5. **Fantasy PPR by final contract year of a multi-year contract**  

Since final contract year performances were the second best, I wanted to gain a better understanding of them as well. I analyzed the breakdown by position:
 
![Visualization](viz/final_year_contract_by_position.png)

The breakdown shows the same order: quarterbacks, wide receivers, running backs, and tight ends.


### Availability & Fantasy Performance
6. **PPR vs. Average Games Played**  

Next, I wanted to explore whether a playerâ€™s performance is influenced by the average number of games they've played each season throughout their career.

![Visualization](viz/avg_ppr_by_avg_games_played.png)

Interestingly, average PPR is heavily influenced by the number of games played. Players who average around 1 game per season tend to have high PPR, but this isnâ€™t relevant, as fantasy managers typically avoid drafting players with such limited playing time. I would highlight players who average around 8 games per season, as they show a significantly higher average than players with 9 or fewer games. However, the highest average PPR belongs to players who average around 15 games per season. As a fantasy football manager, I would definitely focus on these players, as they not only have the best skill â€”availabilityâ€” but also the highest average PPR, making them a valuable asset to any fantasy team.

7. **Availability breakdown by position**

## Insights & Findings
- **Do players perform better in contract years?**  
- **Do rookies outperform veterans on a per-game basis?**  
- **Does missing games predict future unavailability?**  

---

## Final Thoughts
This analysis helps fantasy football managers identify undervalued players by considering both **contract status** and **availability trends**. By modeling these factors, we can make data-driven draft decisions and reduce risk when selecting players.
