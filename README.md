## Introduction
For this edition of Paradime's data modeling challenge, I set out to uncover insights for fantasy football players using NFL-related datasets. My main goal was to analyze two key factors that impact fantasy performance:  
1. **Player Contracts** â€“ How does a player's contract status (rookie year, final year, mid-contract) relate to their fantasy performance?  
2. **Player Availability** â€“ Does past availability (games played) predict future fantasy output?  

To explore these questions, I combined player performance data with contract history, using dbtâ„¢, Snowflake, and visualization tools.

## Data Sources
I used two primary datasets:  

- **NFL_PLAYERS_STATS_2015_2025** â€“ A game-level dataset of NFL player statistics from the past 10 years, pulled using the `nfl_data_py` API (script provided by Paradime).  
- **NFL_CONTRACTS** â€“ A dataset containing 20+ years of player contract history. I scraped this data from [OverTheCap](https://overthecap.com/contract-history) using a custom Python script ([script link]).

## Methodology

### Tools Used
- **Paradime** â€“ dbtâ„¢ modeling and SQL  
- **Snowflake** â€“ Data warehousing  
- **Lightdash** â€“ Data visualization  
- **Python** â€“ Data extraction (from `nfl_data_py` and OverTheCap scraping)  

### Data Preparation & Modeling

1. Extracted 10 years of player data to ensure enough overlap between player contracts and performance.  
   - Longer contracts (4-6 years) mean some players might not have multiple contract periods within a shorter window.  
   - I avoided older data to minimize the impact of changes in the gameâ€™s style and rules.  

2. Built two **staging models**:  
   - `stg_contracts` â€“ Cleaned and structured contract data.  
   - `stg_player_stats_by_game` â€“ Organized player performance on a per-game basis.  

3. Created an **intermediate model** (`int_fantasy_points`) to:  
   - Aggregate performance data at the **season level**.  
   - Select the **top 100** players from each season based on:
     - **Total PPR points** (important for season-long leagues).  
     - **Average PPR points per game** (to account for injuries and missed games).  
   - While standard fantasy leagues typically have 150-240 rostered players, the **top 100** represents the **core fantasy-relevant players**â€”those who are consistently starters and have the most impact on season outcomes.  

   This approach ensures we donâ€™t exclude high-performing but injury-prone players solely due to missed games.  

4. Built **fact models** to analyze different aspects:  
   - `fct_contract_year` â€“ Identifies players' **first and last contract years** within the 10-year period.  
   - `fct_player_availability` â€“ Focuses on how **games played** affects fantasy performance.

## Visuals & Key Metrics

### General Analysis
Added two general visuals just to have a better understanding about the dataset:

1. **Number of players by position**  

![Visualization](viz/number_of_players_per_position.png)

2. **PPR distribution per position**  

![Visualization](viz/ppr_per_position.png)

### Contracts & Fantasy Performance
3. **PPR by is_final_year**  

![Visualization](viz/ppr_by_final_year.png)

I had an assupmtion that final year performances would be better then every other season. However, we don't yet see that on this chart, so I continued my analysis:

![Visualization](viz/ppr_by_first_year.png)

Taking a look at this visual we can see that players in their first contract year perform worse. Could be because of rookie seasons.

Adding both flags to the analysis shows some interesting insights, but for better interpretation I created these categories based on the two flags:

![Visualization](viz/ppr_by_contract_status.png)

We can see that it is actually players in "Mid-contract" perform best, right ahead of players in their final year. Players on 1-year contract perform worst.


4. **Mid-contract performance breakdown** (by contract year & position)
Having seen this I wanted to better understand "Mid-contract" players so I broke Avg PPR down by which year of the contract the players are in:

![Visualization](viz/mid_contract_by_contract_year.png)

Players in their 6th year perform best, while players in their second year have the lowest Avg PPR.

Also checked a position breakdown:

![Visualization](viz/mid_contract_by_position.png)

Quarterbacks are the best-performers, while Tight-ends are the worst.

5. **Fantasy PPR by first contract year of a multi-year contract**

### Availability & Fantasy Performance
6. **PPR vs. Average Games Played**

9. **Availability breakdown by position**

## Insights & Findings
- **Do players perform better in contract years?**  
- **Do rookies outperform veterans on a per-game basis?**  
- **Does missing games predict future unavailability?**  

---

## Final Thoughts
This analysis helps fantasy football managers identify undervalued players by considering both **contract status** and **availability trends**. By modeling these factors, we can make data-driven draft decisions and reduce risk when selecting players.
