### Step 1: Master Required Tools
- Explore Paradime's code IDE, AI development, data explorer, and lineage tools
- Understand Snowflake schemas and tables in your fantasy football datasets
- Learn to connect dbt‚Ñ¢ models and build Lightdash dashboards

### Step 2: Explore and Enhance the Data
- Examine pre-loaded fantasy football datasets
- Consider external data sources to enhance analysis (injury reports, game results, weather conditions, draft prospects, depth charts, etc.)

### Step 3: Generate Insights
Uncover NFL insights related to fantasy football‚Äîthe possibilities are endless!

**Potential Insight Areas with Pre-Loaded Datasets:**  
- **Top Performers by Week/Season**: Using [player_stats_by_game](https://github.com/paradime-io/nfl_data_modeling_challenge/blob/main/models/staging/stg_player_stats_by_game.sql), identify highest-scoring players each week and over the season.  
- **Team Defense Impact**: Using [play_by_play](https://github.com/paradime-io/nfl_data_modeling_challenge/blob/main/models/staging/stg_play_by_play.sql), determine which defenses give up the most fantasy points by position.  
- **Red Zone Efficiency**: Using [play_by_play](https://github.com/paradime-io/nfl_data_modeling_challenge/blob/main/models/staging/stg_play_by_play.sql), pinpoint which players or teams excel in scoring opportunities inside the 20-yard line.

**Potential Insight Areas with External Datasets:**  
- Top scoring players by week/season  
- Player consistency analysis (boom/bust metrics)  
- Impact of team matchups on player performance  
- Identifying players with high injury propensity  
- Forecasting 2025 draft prospects  

### Step 4: Visualize with Lightdash
- Create clear, informative dashboards w/ written conclusions
- Use dbt‚Ñ¢ models as metric sources (optional)
- Ensure visualizations support your conclusions

## üåü Additional NFL Data

If you want to pull additional NFL data for your analysis, you can use the **nfl_data_py** library, the same tool we used to pre-load datasets into Snowflake:

- **GitHub Repo**: [nfl_data_py](https://github.com/nflverse/nfl_data_py)

For reference, the scripts we used to load the pre-loaded datasets can be found in the [**Scripts**](https://github.com/paradime-io/nfl_data_modeling_challenge/tree/main/scripts) folder of this repository.
