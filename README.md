## Introduction
For this edition of Paradime's data modeling challenge, I set out to uncover insights for fantasy football players using NFL-related datasets. My main goal was to analyze two key factors that impact fantasy performance:  
1. **Player Contracts** â€“ How does a player's contract status (rookie year, final year, mid-contract) relate to their fantasy performance?  
2. **Player Availability** â€“ Does past availability (games played) predict future fantasy output?  

To explore these questions, I combined player performance data with contract history, using dbtâ„¢, Snowflake, and visualization tools.

## Data Sources
I used two primary datasets:  

- **NFL_PLAYERS_STATS_2015_2025** â€“ A game-level dataset of NFL player statistics from the past 10 years, pulled using the `nfl_data_py` API (script provided by Paradime).  
- **NFL_CONTRACTS** â€“ A dataset containing 20+ years of player contract history. I scraped this data from [OverTheCap](https://overthecap.com/contract-history) using a custom Python script ([script link]).

## Methodology

### Tools Used
- **Paradime** â€“ dbtâ„¢ modeling and SQL  
- **Snowflake** â€“ Data warehousing  
- **Lightdash** â€“ Data visualization  
- **Python** â€“ Data extraction (from `nfl_data_py` and OverTheCap scraping)  

### Data Preparation & Modeling

1. Extracted 10 years of player data to ensure enough overlap between player contracts and performance.  
   - Longer contracts (4-6 years) mean some players might not have multiple contract periods within a shorter window.  
   - I avoided older data to minimize the impact of changes in the gameâ€™s style and rules.  

2. Built two **staging models**:  
   - `stg_contracts` â€“ Cleaned and structured contract data.  
   - `stg_player_stats_by_game` â€“ Organized player performance on a per-game basis.  

3. Created an **intermediate model** (`int_fantasy_points`) to:  
   - Aggregate performance data at the **season level**.  
   - Select the **top 100** players from each season based on:
     - **Total PPR points** (important for season-long leagues).  
     - **Average PPR points per game** (to account for injuries and missed games).  
   - While standard fantasy leagues typically have 150-240 rostered players, the **top 100** represents the **core fantasy-relevant players**â€”those who are consistently starters and have the most impact on season outcomes.  

   This approach ensures we donâ€™t exclude high-performing but injury-prone players solely due to missed games.  

4. Built **fact models** to analyze different aspects:  
   - `fct_contract_year` â€“ Identifies players' **first and last contract years** within the 10-year period.  
   - `fct_player_availability` â€“ Focuses on how **games played** affects fantasy performance.

## Visuals & Key Metrics

### General Analysis

I included two general visuals to gain a clearer understanding of the dataset:

1. **Number of players by position**  

![Visualization](viz/number_of_players_per_position.png)

2. **PPR distribution per position**  

![Visualization](viz/ppr_per_position.png)

### Contracts & Fantasy Performance
3. **PPR by is_final_year**  

![Visualization](viz/ppr_by_final_year.png)

I initially assumed that players' performances in their final year would be better than in any other season. However, this trend isn't apparent in the chart, so I proceeded with further analysis:

![Visualization](viz/ppr_by_first_year.png)

Looking at this visual, we can observe that players in their first contract year tend to perform worse, likely due to the challenges of rookie seasons.

Incorporating both flags into the analysis reveals some interesting insights. To improve interpretation, Iâ€™ve created these categories based on the two flags:

![Visualization](viz/ppr_by_contract_status.png)

Itâ€™s clear that players in the 'Mid-contract' phase perform the best, followed closely by those in their final year. Players on 1-year contracts have the lowest performance.


4. **Mid-contract performance breakdown** (by contract year & position)

After observing this, I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of 'Mid-contract' players, so I broke down the average PPR by the specific year of the contract the players are in:

![Visualization](viz/mid_contract_by_contract_year.png)

Players in their 6th year perform the best, while those in their second year have the lowest average PPR.

I also analyzed the breakdown by position:

![Visualization](viz/mid_contract_by_position.png)

Quarterbacks are the top performers, while tight ends rank the lowest.

5. **Fantasy PPR by first contract year of a multi-year contract**  

I wanted better understanding of the first contract year performances too, even

### Availability & Fantasy Performance
6. **PPR vs. Average Games Played**

9. **Availability breakdown by position**

## Insights & Findings
- **Do players perform better in contract years?**  
- **Do rookies outperform veterans on a per-game basis?**  
- **Does missing games predict future unavailability?**  

---

## Final Thoughts
This analysis helps fantasy football managers identify undervalued players by considering both **contract status** and **availability trends**. By modeling these factors, we can make data-driven draft decisions and reduce risk when selecting players.
