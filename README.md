## Data Sources
Primary datasets used:
- **Play-by-Play Data (2023 Season)**
  - Contains detailed play-level information
  - Includes EPA (Expected Points Added), WPA (Win Probability Added)
  - Red zone and scoring play details
  
- **Player Statistics by Game (2023 Season)**
  - Player-level performance metrics
  - Game-by-game statistics
  - Advanced metrics like air yards and EPA

## Methodology

### Data Pipeline Architecture
1. **Staging Layer**
   - Standardized play-by-play data (`stg_play_by_play`)
   - Cleaned player statistics (`stg_player_stats_by_game`)

2. **Intermediate Layer**
   - Team performance metrics (`int_team_performance`)
   - QB analysis (`int_qb_performance`)

3. **Analytics Layer**
   - Team comparisons (`fct_team_comparison`)
   - Final prediction model (`fct_superbowl_prediction`)

### Key Metrics and Calculations
- **Team Efficiency**: Season-long EPA/play
- **Red Zone Performance**: Touchdown conversion rate in red zone situations
- **Quarterback Impact**: QB-specific EPA and success rates
- **Win Probability Model**: Weighted combination of key performance indicators
