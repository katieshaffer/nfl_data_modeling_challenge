## Introduction

Welcome, fellow Value Hunters! This dashboard is your treasure map to uncovering hidden gems in the world of fantasy football. We're not just chasing points; we're hunting *value* ‚Äì those players who outperform their perceived worth, giving you the edge you need to dominate your league.  Think of it as Moneyball for fantasy football, but with cooler charts. 


## Data Sources <a name="data-sources"></a>

*   [nfl_data_py](https://github.com/nflverse/nfl_data_py): Library for interacting with NFL data and includes data for play-by-play data, weekly data, seasonal data, rosters, win totals, scoring lines, officials, draft picks.

*   [2023 NFL Salary](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/rankings/player/_/year/2023/sort/cap_base): Scraped from spotrac for player's salary for season 2023.

## Methodology

### Tools Used:

*   Paradime for dbt‚Ñ¢ modeling and SQL development ‚Äì Where the magic happens.
*   Snowflake for data warehousing ‚Äì  Our data fortress.
*   Lightdash for data visualization ‚Äì Turning numbers into narratives.


### Applied Techniques:

We used dbt to wrangle the data into shape, employing:

*   **Dimensional Modeling:** Creating star schemas for efficient analysis ‚Äì because nobody likes slow queries.
*   **Data Aggregation:** Calculating key metrics like total points, consistency, red zone efficiency, and ROI.
*   **Data Quality Tests:** Ensuring our data is clean and reliable ‚Äì garbage in, garbage out, as they say.
*   **Metric Calculation:**  Building our "value hunter" toolbox with custom metrics.

## Insights <a name="insights"></a>

*   **Consistency is King (or Queen):**  High points are great, but *consistent* high points are gold.
*   **ROI is the Ultimate Value Metric:**  It's not just about points; it's about points *per dollar*.
*   **Injuries Can Make or Break a Season:**  Staying on top of injury trends is crucial.
*   **Knees and Ankles Take a Beating:**  Protect those joints!
*   **(Hypothetical Example):**  "We found that [Player X], despite a mid-range salary, consistently outperformed players with much higher salaries, making him a true value pick. However, his late-season knee injury (as seen in the injury charts) raises concerns about his future performance."

## Conclusions <a name="conclusions"></a>

This dashboard empowers you to become a true "Value Hunter" in your fantasy league.  By combining data-driven insights with a bit of savvy, you can build a winning team without breaking the bank (or your salary cap).  Remember, it's not just about chasing stars; it's about finding the players who shine brightest for their cost!
