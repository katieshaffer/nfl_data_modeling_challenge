## üõ† Building Your Project

### Step 1: Master Required Tools

- **Paradime**: Explore the code IDE, AI-enabled development (DinoAI), data explorer, and lineage tools.
- **Snowflake**: Understand schemas and tables in your given fantasy football datasets.
- **Lightdash**: Learn how to connect dbt‚Ñ¢ models and build meaningful dashboards.

### Step 2: Explore and Enhance the Data

- Start by examining the two pre-loaded fantasy football datasets in Snowflake. You are welcome to use these data sets in your project, but it's not required. 
- Consider which external data sources you will use to enhance your analysis (e.g., player injury reports, historic game results, weather conditions, upcoming draft prospects, etc.).

### Step 3: Generate Insights

- Uncover trends in player performance, positional value, team strengths/weaknesses, or season-long projections.
- Potential avenues:
  - Top scoring players by week or season
  - Player consistency and variance
  - Impact of team matchups on fantasy outputs
- Aim for insights that are both accurate and compelling.

### Step 4: Visualize with Lightdash

- Create dashboards and visualizations that clearly communicate your insights.
- Leverage dbt‚Ñ¢ models as a single source of truth for metrics.
- Ensure visuals are easy to interpret and deliver meaningful conclusions.
